### Project "Simple Registration System in Java"

This is a small Java programming language project that implements a basic user registration system. The project is designed for those who are learning Java and want to grasp the fundamentals of working with lists, user input, and conditional statements.

### Key Features:

1. **User Registration:** The program allows users to input their name and password to register in the system.

2. **Name and Password Validation:** When logging into the system, the user must enter their name and password. The system verifies whether a user with the given name and password exists in the system.

3. **Simple and Understandable Code:** The project is developed using basic Java constructs, making it easy for beginners to understand how the code works.

### How to Use the Project:

1. **Download the Code:** First, download the project code from the GitHub repository.

2. **Compilation and Execution:** Open the project in your Java editor, compile, and run the program.

3. **Enter Name and Password:** After running the program, input your name and password to register in the system. Then, enter your name and password for logging in.

4. **Check the Results:** The system will inform you about successful registration or login, or any errors that might occur.

### Project Requirements:

- Java JDK is installed on your computer.

### Example Usage:

```java
// Creating a registration object
ArrayList<String> names = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> passwords = new ArrayList<>();
signup registration = new signup(names, passwords);
login logining = new login(names, passwords);

// Registering a new user
registration.ask();

// Checking the login
logining.logask();
```

This project serves as an excellent exercise for learning Java basics, helping you understand the principles of working with lists and user input in the console. The robustly implemented registration system aids in grasping conditional statements and logic in Java.
